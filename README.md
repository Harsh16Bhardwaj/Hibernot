# Hibernot

**Hibernot** is a lightweight TypeScript/JavaScript utility for keeping your Node.js services "warm" by automatically running a keep-alive function after a period of inactivity. It's especially useful for serverless or containerized environments where you want to avoid cold starts or resource hibernation due to inactivity.

---

## Why Hibernot?

Many cloud providers or hosting platforms will scale down, hibernate, or cold-start your service if it hasn't received traffic for a while. Hibernot helps you prevent this by running a custom keep-alive function (like a ping or a warm-up task) after a configurable period of inactivity.

## Installation

```bash
npm install hibernot
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Import and Configure

```typescript
import { Hibernot } from 'hibernot';

const hibernot = new Hibernot({
  inactivityLimit: 60000, // 1 minute in milliseconds
  keepAliveFn: async () => {
    // Your keep-alive logic here (e.g., ping a health endpoint, warm up cache, etc.)
    console.log('Keep-alive triggered!');
  },
  instanceName: 'MyService', // Optional, for logging
  maxRetryAttempts: 5        // Optional, default is 3
});
```

---

### 2. Integrate with Express (or any middleware-based framework)

If you're using Express, you can use the built-in middleware to automatically register activity on every request:

```typescript
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

app.use(hibernot.middleware());

// ... your routes here

app.listen(3000);
```

---

### 3. Manual Activity Registration

If you want to manually signal activity (for example, from a non-HTTP event), just call:

```typescript
hibernot.registerActivity();
```

---

### 4. Monitoring and Control

- **Get stats:**  
  Retrieve current stats for monitoring or debugging:
  ```typescript
  console.log(hibernot.getStats());
  ```

- **Reset activity count:**  
  Useful for tests or monitoring resets:
  ```typescript
  hibernot.resetActivityCount();
  ```

- **Stop the timer:**  
  If you want to disable inactivity detection (e.g., during shutdown):
  ```typescript
  hibernot.stop();
  ```

## Configuration Options

| Option             | Type             | Required | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| inactivityLimit    | `number`         | Yes      | Time in ms to wait before triggering `keepAliveFn` after inactivity.        |
| keepAliveFn        | `() => Promise`  | Yes      | Async function to call when inactivity limit is reached.                    |
| instanceName       | `string`         | No       | Optional name for logging/debugging.                                        |
| maxRetryAttempts   | `number`         | No       | How many times to retry `keepAliveFn` on failure (default: 3).              |

---

## How It Works

- Every time activity is registered (via HTTP request or manually), Hibernot resets its inactivity timer.
- If no activity occurs for `inactivityLimit` ms, Hibernot calls your `keepAliveFn`.
- If `keepAliveFn` fails, it will retry up to `maxRetryAttempts` times (with a 1-second delay between attempts).
- After a successful keep-alive, Hibernot registers a new activity, so the cycle continues.

## Example: Full Setup

```typescript
import { Hibernot } from 'hibernot';
import express from 'express';

const hibernot = new Hibernot({
  inactivityLimit: 120000, // 2 minutes
  keepAliveFn: async () => {
    // Example: ping your own health endpoint
    await fetch('https://your-service/health');
  },
  instanceName: 'API',
  maxRetryAttempts: 2
});

const app = express();
app.use(hibernot.middleware());

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!'));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this outside of Express?**  
A: Yes! Just call `registerActivity()` whenever you want to signal activity.

**Q: What happens if my keepAliveFn keeps failing?**  
A: Hibernot will retry up to `maxRetryAttempts` times, then log an error and continue monitoring.

**Q: Is this safe for production?**  
A: Yes, but make sure your `keepAliveFn` is idempotent and doesn't cause side effects if called repeatedly.
