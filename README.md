# @nightsWatch/hibernot

A planned NPM package to prevent database hibernation in free-tier cloud services like Supabase and MongoDB Atlas by sending periodic API pings.

## The Problem

Free-tier cloud databases (e.g., Supabase, MongoDB Atlas) hibernate after inactivity (e.g., 15mâ€“7d), pausing compute resources to save costs. This causes 5â€“30s wakeup delays when an API call hits the database, leading to:

- **User Experience Issues**: Slow responses for the first request after inactivity (e.g., app loading delays).
- **API Failures**: Timeouts or connection errors if wakeup exceeds client timeouts (e.g., 10s HTTP requests).
- **Development Complexity**: Programmers must implement retries or caching, increasing app complexity.

This impacts application programmers, especially on low-traffic apps (e.g., prototypes, side projects), where hibernation is common on free tiers, degrading performance and reliability.

## What Weâ€™re Thinking of Building

**Hibernot** aims to keep databases active by periodically pinging their APIs, preventing hibernation for Node.js apps.

### Wishful Features

- **Periodic Pinging**: Send lightweight queries (e.g., `SELECT 1` for Supabase, `db.ping()` for MongoDB) at configurable intervals (e.g., every 5â€“15m).
- **Traffic-Based Scheduling**: Adjust ping frequency based on app traffic to minimize unnecessary requests.
- **Multi-Database Support**: Target Supabase, MongoDB Atlas, and potentially others (e.g., PlanetScale).
- **Low Resource Usage**: Optimize pings to respect API rate limits and avoid extra costs.
- **Simple Setup**: Easy integration with minimal configuration for Node.js apps.

## Current Status

This package is in the **planning phase**. Weâ€™re refining the concept and seeking community input before development. No code exists yet, but weâ€™re committed to solving the hibernation problem for budget-conscious developers.
